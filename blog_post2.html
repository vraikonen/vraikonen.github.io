                        <h1>ISSonVis 2023 - Maps & Warfare & News Coverage </h1>
                        <p class="intro">This is a report on one of two summer schools I have completed for Copernicus Master in Digital Earth curriculum.
                        </p>
                  <p> ISSonVis 2023 was a captivating and intellectually stimulating summer school program that delved into the intersection of maps, warfare, and news coverage. This summer school aimed to provide participants with a comprehensive understanding of the historical, geopolitical, and media-related aspects of these topics. The schedule was filled with engaging lectures and interactive sessions, offering a diverse learning experience to all the participants.</p>
                  <p> During the ISSonVis 2023 summer school, we had the opportunity to explore a variety of captivating topics. One such topic was “Geopolitics and Big Tech – Legitimizing Collaborations”, where presenters inquired into the intricate relationship between geopolitics and big tech companies, discussing potential collaborations and their implications in global scenarios. Another engaging session was “Energy Security and Geopolitics in Contemporary Europe”. This session examined the complexities of energy security and how geopolitics play a significant role in shaping the energy landscape in Europe. The discussions provided valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities related to energy resources, and it highlighted the interplay between energy policies and international relations. Understanding the critical importance of energy security in today’s world has left a lasting impact on my perspective, and I now have a deeper appreciation for the intricate dynamics that influence global energy systems.</p>
                  <p> Among the diverse and intriguing topics covered in ISSonVis 2023, the one that captured my attention the most was “Maps of Languages and Their Dialects in Current Geopolitics” by Vít Voženílek. The topic explored the use of linguistic maps and dialects as geopolitical tools, revealing how language plays a crucial role in shaping political landscapes worldwide. I found this topic particularly fascinating due to its interdisciplinary nature and its relevance in understanding contemporary geopolitical dynamics. Language is a powerful instrument that influences cultural identity, political affiliations, and international relations. By exploring how linguistic maps and dialects are employed strategically in geopolitics, I gained valuable insights into the complexity of global interactions. Moreover, Vít Voženílek’s engaging presentation style and the inclusion of real-world examples made the topic even more captivating. I was inspired to contemplate the impact of language on diplomatic negotiations, regional alliances, and the formation of national identities.</p> 
                  <p> ISSonVis 2023 provided an enriching and diverse learning experience. Each topic covered during the summer school offered unique insights into the interconnectedness of maps, warfare, and news coverage. However, the exploration of “Maps of Languages and Their Dialects in Current Geopolitics” stood out to me as the most intriguing and enlightening aspect of the program. The knowledge gained from this summer school has undoubtedly broadened my understanding of global affairs and fueled my passion for exploring the intricate relationships between various facets of our world.</p>
